## Description

This is an authentication and authoriztion setup for Node.js starting in it's simplest form. Hoping to make more upgrades to it Soon. This is a Sign Up and Sign In setup where users can register their information in order to acess unauthorized information.

## The Purpose of this project

The main purpose of this site is to collect the data of users and store it in the database through authorization and authentication means. Users are entitled to how they handle their data and they can choose if they want to leave it here or delete it. If a user doesn't want to leave their information here but want to see the website, they are allowed to put dummy data ino this site. And very important, if the user wants to opt out or delete his or her information, he or she can go ahead becuase users are responsible for their own data and how or what they want to do with it.
