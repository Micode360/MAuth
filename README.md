## Description

This is an authentication and authorization setup for Node.js starting in its simplest form. Hoping to make more upgrades to it Soon. This is a Sign-Up and Sign In setup where users can register their information to access unauthorized information.

## The Purpose of this project

The main purpose of this site is to collect the data of users and store it in the database through authorization and authentication means. Users are entitled to how they handle their data and they can choose if they want to leave it here or delete it. If a user doesn't want to leave their information here but wants to see the website, they are allowed to put dummy data into this site. And very importantly, if the user wants to opt-out or deletes his or her information, he or she can go ahead because users are responsible for their data and how or what they want to do with it.
